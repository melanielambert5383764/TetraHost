## What Is Asynchronous Web Scraping?

Asynchronous web scraping refers to scraping techniques that leverage asynchronous I/O operations. Unlike traditional synchronous scraping, where each request blocks the execution of subsequent tasks until a response is received, asynchronous scraping allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, significantly boosting efficiency.

## Introduction to Aiohttp Framework

Aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client and server framework built for Python. By harnessing Pythonâ€™s coroutine features, Aiohttp provides a flexible and efficient way to handle HTTP requests and responses. It is particularly well-suited for building high-performance web scraping tools.

### Key Benefits of Aiohttp

- **Asynchronous Execution**: Handles thousands of requests simultaneously.
- **Flexibility**: Easy to configure for different types of HTTP requests.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Pythonâ€™s asyncio library.

## Core Concepts of Asynchronous Scraping

To effectively use asynchronous scraping, it is essential to understand the following concepts:

1. **Asynchronous I/O**: Allows other tasks to proceed while waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
2. **Coroutines**: Lightweight threads for executing asynchronous tasks.
3. **Event Loops**: The control center for managing and scheduling coroutines.

## Getting Started: Environment Setup

Before diving into coding, ensure that Python and the required dependencies are installed. You can install Aiohttp and asyncio using the following commands:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
pip install asyncio
```

## Accessing HTTPS Pages via Proxy Using Aiohttp

At times, accessing certain websites may require the use of proxies. Aiohttp simplifies this process, as demonstrated in the example below:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch(url, proxy):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100, ssl=False)
        proxy_auth = aiohttp.BasicAuth("proxyUser", "proxyPass")
        async with session.get(url, proxy=proxy, connector=connector, proxy_auth=proxy_auth) as response:
            return await response.text()

url = "https://example.com"
proxy = "http://proxyUser:proxyPass@proxyHost:proxyPort/"
html = asyncio.run(fetch(url, proxy))
print(html)
```

## Advanced Proxy Access Using Async Coroutines

For even greater efficiency, you can use advanced coroutines to manage proxy-based web scraping:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    proxy = "http://proxyUser:proxyPass@proxyHost:proxyPort/"
    url = "https://example.com"
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        html = await fetch(url, session)
        print(html)

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

## Practical Example: Scraping WeChat Articles

Letâ€™s apply Aiohttp to scrape article data from WeChatâ€™s API. This example demonstrates how to send multiple asynchronous requests and handle JSON responses.

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_article(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()

async def main():
    urls = [
        'https://api.weixin.qq.com/get_article_list',
        'https://api.weixin.qq.com/get_article_list'
    ]
    tasks = [fetch_article(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```
