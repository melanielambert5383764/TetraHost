## Introduction

[Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/) is the worldâ€™s largest company by [revenue](https://companiesmarketcap.com/largest-companies-by-revenue/) and [number of employees](https://companiesmarketcap.com/largest-companies-by-number-of-employees/). Contrary to popular belief, Walmart is much more than just a retail corporationâ€”itâ€™s also one of the largest e-commerce websites in the world. This makes Walmart a valuable source of product information.

- Monitor product prices and stock levels
- Analyze market trends and customer behavior
- Create applications based on real-time Walmart data

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn two different methods for scraping Walmart data. First, weâ€™ll show you how to use Python and Selenium to scrape Walmart step by step. Then, weâ€™ll introduce the easier and more efficient approach of using ScraperAPI to scrape Walmart data seamlessly.

## Method 1: Scraping Walmart with Python and Selenium

### What Is Selenium?

Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browsers, commonly used for testing web applications. It can also be utilized for web scraping tasks due to its ability to simulate user interactions in a browser.

Using Selenium, you can automate browsing, searching, and extracting data from Walmart. However, this approach can be challenging for beginners, as Walmart employs various anti-scraping mechanisms.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up Selenium**:  
   Install the Selenium library and a browser driver (e.g., [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)). Refer to the [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/overview/) for installation instructions.

2. **Open Walmart.com**:  
   Use Python and Selenium to launch a browser and navigate to Walmartâ€™s homepage. Hereâ€™s an example:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
   from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

   s = Service('/path/to/chromedriver')
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=s)

   driver.get("https://www.walmart.com")
   ```

3. **Search for Products**:  
   Inspect Walmartâ€™s search bar using the browserâ€™s developer tools to identify its attributes. Then, use Selenium to input a search term and retrieve results.

   ```python
   search = driver.find_element("name", "q")
   search.send_keys("Gaming Laptops")
   search.send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
   ```

4. **Extract Product Information**:  
   Use Seleniumâ€™s methods to extract product titles, prices, and reviews. For example:

   ```python
   title = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "h1")
   print(title.text)

   price = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[itemprop="price"]')
   print(price.text)
   ```
