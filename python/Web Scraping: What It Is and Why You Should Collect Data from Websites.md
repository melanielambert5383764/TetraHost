## What Is Web Scraping?

Letâ€™s start with the basics. Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is the automated process of collecting data from websites. Unlike manual data collection, scraping is faster and highly scalable. If youâ€™ve ever manually gathered data from multiple websites, you know how time-consuming that can be. Web scraping automates this process, allowing you to collect large amounts of data in minutes.

A related term you might hear is **web crawling**, which refers to indexing web pages, as used by search engines like Google. Web scraping, on the other hand, focuses on extracting specific data from these pages.

In this article, weâ€™ll stick to the term "web scraping" to discuss collecting data from websites.

## How Does Web Scraping Work?

The web scraping process consists of several stages:

1. **Define Objectives and Target Pages**: Determine your scraping goals and identify the pages you want to extract data from.
2. **Load HTML Code**: Use scraping tools to download the HTML code of the target pages.
3. **Extract Data**: Identify and collect the necessary data, such as text, images, or tables, ensuring proper organization for further processing.
4. **Adjust Scraping Tools**: Regularly update and reconfigure your tools as websites often change their structure.

You can use various scraping tools, from ready-made services to custom-built solutions in Python or Node.js. If you have programming skills, creating a custom scraper tailored to your specific needs may be the best option.

## Web Scraping Methods

### Static Scraping

This method is suitable for pages that fully load all content at once. Itâ€™s simpler and faster since all data is easily accessible in the HTML code.

### Dynamic Scraping

Dynamic scraping is used for pages where content loads later, often via JavaScript. For example, online stores might dynamically load prices and availability based on your location. Advanced tools like **ScraperAPI** help bypass such barriers by simulating requests from various geographic locations.
