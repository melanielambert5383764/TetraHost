## Configuration Options

### `searchTerm`
Specify the search query to find articles. For example:
```javascript
searchTerm: "The Oscars"
```
If you provide both `searchTerm` and `baseUrl`, the scraper defaults to returning results from the [Google News homepage](https://news.google.com).

### `baseUrl`
Define an alternate base URL for your search, useful for specific [Google News topics](https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqJggKIiBDQkFTRWdvSUwyMHZNRGRqTVhZU0FtVnVHZ0pWVXlnQVAB).

### `prettyURLs`
By default, the scraper decodes Google's "ugly" article links into readable "pretty" URLs. To keep the original links, set `prettyURLs` to `false`.

### `getArticleContent`
Enable this to retrieve the full content of each article. Be aware that it significantly increases execution time.

### `timeframe`
Filter articles published within a specific timeframe. Use a string format like:
- `1y`: One year
- `7d`: Seven days (default)

### `logLevel`
Set the logging level:
- `none`: No logs
- `error`: Only errors
- `warn`: Errors and warnings
- `info`: Info, errors, and warnings
- `verbose`: All logs, including debug info

Defaults to `error`.

### `puppeteerArgs`
Pass additional Chromium flags for Puppeteer. Example:
```javascript
puppeteerArgs: ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"]
```

### `puppeteerHeadlessMode`
Run Puppeteer in [headless mode](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/puppeteer-headless) for better performance. Defaults to `true`.

## Performance

A sample query returned 94 results in 4.5 seconds with article content enabled, and 3.6 seconds without it. Performance depends on variables like network speed and query complexity.

> **Note:** Google News Scraper relies on DOM selectors, so changes to Google News' structure may break functionality. Submit an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lewisdonovan/google-news-scraper) if you encounter problems.
