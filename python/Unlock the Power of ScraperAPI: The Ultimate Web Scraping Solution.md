### Advanced Features for Customization

#### Auto-Parsing Responses
ScraperAPI supports auto-parsing, which returns structured JSON data directly from the scraped webpage. Use the following Python script to implement this feature:
```python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = 'https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-COMMUTER-iPhone-Pro-ONLY/dp/B0B7CH8DMR/'
headers = {
    'ScraperAPI-Parameters': 'autoparse=true'
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, proxies={'https': f'http://{API_KEY}@scraperapi.smartproxy.com:8000'})
data = response.json()

print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
```

#### Geo-Targeting
Scrape data from specific countries using the `country` parameter. For instance, to target data from the UK:
```python
headers = {
    'ScraperAPI-Parameters': 'country=GB'
}
```
